# Seamless
Seamless is a demo for a notes app. Write as you would normally, Seamless does the formatting.

## Why Seamless?

Note apps feel unnatural. Creating a task, clicking it for a subtask, hitting enter, etc. We're used to sentences. How would we write notes down in paper?
Seamless takes care of that.

#### Example
Typing "Do laundry: separate by colors, wash, dry, put away."

Outputs your main task (in this case, "Do laundry") with its subtasks nested, and understands you're done for now with the full stop, so it creates a new task ready for you to write.

## Use

Start typing for your main task. Using ":" creates your subtasks, and "." or enter finishes that list of subtasks and creates your next task. If a task is blank it's automatically deleted. That's it!
